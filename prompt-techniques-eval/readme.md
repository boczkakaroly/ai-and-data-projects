🧠 Prompt Engineering: Solving Real-Life Dilemmas

How a Government Administrator Prompted His Way Out of Bureaucracy

Developed by Károly Boczka
Multilingual AI Evaluator & Data Analyst — October 2025
Model: ChatGPT-5

🗂️ Project Overview

Most prompt-engineering guides start with abstract toy examples.
This project began with a real, human question:

Can a mid-career government employee rebuild his professional life through AI?

What followed wasn’t a chat — it was an experiment in reasoning.
Each prompt built upon the previous one, transforming an open-ended personal dilemma into a structured, evaluable roadmap.

The process applied core evaluator tools:

Chain-of-Thought reasoning

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Self-critique and adversarial testing

Cross-model validation

The result is both story and system — a creative proof that structured prompting can function as career design, decision analysis, and evaluator training all at once.

🧩 Structure Summary

The project unfolds through 10 iterative phases, evolving from initial curiosity to full external validation.

Phases 1–3: Explore direction, define constraints, and map personal context.

Phases 4–6: Build structure, integrate evaluation logic, and finalize the Masterplan.

Phases 7–10: Stress-test reasoning through realism, self-critique, contradiction, and cross-model review.

Each phase includes real excerpts from the dialogues between the author and ChatGPT-5, demonstrating how clarity and critique gradually shape a coherent outcome.

🧭 Prompt Techniques Framework
Phase	Core Technique	Purpose	Evaluation Focus
1. Curiosity	Direct Prompt	Capture the raw question — define the baseline.	Identify ambiguity and tone.
2. Clarification	Chain-of-Thought	Expand reasoning and personalize context.	Logical sequencing, depth.
3. Constraints	Structured Prompting	Frame realistic time, workload, salary limits.	Feasibility and prioritization.
4. Retrieval	RAG Context Injection	Add factual background (skills, portfolio).	Context accuracy and grounding.
5. Reflection	Self-Reflective Prompting	Ask “What’s missing or biased?”	Self-critique, risk awareness.
6. Meta-Alignment	Evaluator Simulation	Audit reasoning and finalize the Masterplan.	Logical and ethical coherence.
7. Deep RAG	Expanded Retrieval	Integrate real market and sector data.	Realism and adaptability.
8. Self-Critique Loop	Model Self-Evaluation	Re-examine assumptions.	Correction quality and humility.
9. Hallucination Test	Adversarial Prompting	Inject contradictions to test stability.	Factual robustness.
10. Masterprompt Test	Cross-Model Evaluation	Validate the plan via other LLMs.	Generalization and reliability.
🪜 Phase Highlights
Phase 1 – Curiosity

The story begins with a simple question:

“Can I change my career with AI?”
The model responds generically — motivation without method. The project starts by turning that vagueness into a measurable process.

Phase 2 – Clarifying Direction

By applying Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the model identifies evaluator work as an ideal fit for a logic-driven, multilingual professional seeking autonomy and depth.

Phase 3 – Defining Constraints

Structured prompting reframes the challenge: He isn’t late to the party — the party hasn’t even started.

Phase 4 – Building the Framework

Using RAG-style retrieval, the system maps skills and milestones into a 6–9-month self-training roadmap — a personalized pipeline toward evaluator readiness.

Phase 5 – Reflection and Self-Critique

The model, for the first time, critiques its own optimism:

“You’ll need proof — volunteer evaluation tasks, real-world projects. That’s how your plan becomes credible.”

Phase 6 – Meta-Alignment (Governance Layer)

Evaluator simulation transforms the plan into an auditable Masterplan with three stages:

Build evaluator literacy.

Volunteer and produce documented results.

Consolidate into paid professional roles.

Phase 7 – Reality Injection

A Deep-RAG layer integrates real-world constraints: market friction, competition, and language-based niche value.

“You’re not behind the wave — you are the wave.”

Phase 8 – Self-Critique Loop

The model acknowledges over-optimism but confirms the plan’s foundation is sound: clarity, logic, and transferable skills.

Phase 9 – Hallucination Test

When stripped of the protagonist’s real assets (data skills, languages), the plan collapses — proving that reasoning, not hype, sustains the path.

Phase 10 – Masterprompt Test

The final plan was cross-evaluated by Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek:

Model	Verdict	Probability	Key Insight
Gemini	Feasible	≈ 75 %	Clear niche; portfolio depth critical.
Claude	Feasible	≈ 75 %	Portfolio-career framing; market saturation risk.
DeepSeek	Feasible	≈ 80 %	Gradual success through incremental projects (18–24 months).

All three confirmed that success was a matter of time, not possibility — with 85–95 % probability over a 3–5 year horizon.

🪞 Epilogue

What started as a casual chat evolved into a structured life experiment — a blend of logic, creativity, and self-evaluation.
Through prompting, the author discovered that decades of diplomacy, language mastery, and analytical habit weren’t obsolete — they were exactly what the AI field was missing.

The bureaucracy stayed the same.
The questions didn’t.
